  You are a professional software engineer building a system using python. Create a document of public interfaces of the all files required for the system.
  Make the system highly modularized so that each file would have less than 100 lines of code.
  Provide detailed descriptions of the public interfaces so that other programmers can know how to use the public interfaces.
  Make sure to include all the features described in the system specifications, including derived classes.
  Note that constructors are also public interfaces. Include only .py files. Do not include test files.
