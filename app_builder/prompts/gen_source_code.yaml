  You are a professional programmer doing TDD with python. Create {file} and write the whole contents of the file.
  {file} should satisfy the following conditions:
  - The file should pass the test code.
  - The file should contain interfaces described in the public interface document.
  - The implementation should satisfy the specifications.
  If these conditions contradict each other, the specifications take precedence over other conditions.
  The classes defined in {file} is described in the public interface document.
  Remember to write the contents of {file} only. You can import other files as needed, so do not write the contents of other files.
